## MPV

Check [Radxa Q6A Docs](https://docs.radxa.com/en/dragon/q6a/system-config/mpv) for instructions on how to set up MPV with hardware acceleration. It also applies to Gaokun3.

## Steam ARM64

Check https://interfacinglinux.com/community/sbcsoftware/native-steam-client-for-arm-linux/ for details.

Pay attention to the libvpx compatibility link on newer distributions.

Or use the following script to install the native Steam client for ARM Linux on Gaokun3:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

STEAM_ROOT="$HOME/.local/share/Steam"
STEAM_RT="$STEAM_ROOT/steamrtarm64"
BOOTSTRAP_URL="https://client-update.steamstatic.com/bins_linuxarm64_linuxarm64.zip.0f11199e9a58a0ec4aab3833152ada1b2e56c846"

echo "==> Install dependencies"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl unzip xdg-utils libnss3 libgtk2.0-0t64 libgtk2.0-common libvpx12 libsdl3-0 libavif16

echo "==> Prepare Steam directory"
mkdir -p "$STEAM_ROOT/package" "$HOME/.steam" "$HOME/.local/share/applications"

if [ ! -x "$STEAM_RT/steam" ]; then
  echo "==> Download Steam ARM64 bootstrap"
  TMPDIR="$(mktemp -d)"
  curl -fL "$BOOTSTRAP_URL" -o "$TMPDIR/steam-arm64.zip"
  unzip -q "$TMPDIR/steam-arm64.zip" 'steamrtarm64/*' -d "$STEAM_ROOT"
  rm -rf "$TMPDIR"
fi

echo "==> Enable public beta and links"
printf 'publicbeta\n' > "$STEAM_ROOT/package/beta"
ln -sfn "$STEAM_ROOT" "$HOME/.steam/steam"
chmod -R u+rwX "$STEAM_RT"

echo "==> Add libvpx compatibility link"
if [ ! -e /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libvpx.so.6 ]; then
  sudo ln -s /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libvpx.so.12 /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libvpx.so.6
fi

echo "==> Create application menu launcher"
cat > "$HOME/.local/share/applications/steam-arm64.desktop" <<EOF
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Steam
Comment=Native Steam client for ARM Linux
Exec=$STEAM_RT/steam %U
Path=$STEAM_RT
Icon=$STEAM_ROOT/public/steam_tray.ico
Terminal=false
Categories=Game;

EOF

chmod +x "$HOME/.local/share/applications/steam-arm64.desktop"
update-desktop-database "$HOME/.local/share/applications" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true

echo
echo "Done. Start Steam from application menu."
```

After completing the setup, you also need to download [Proton 11 ARM64](https://archive.org/download/arm-64proton-runtime-64.tar), which already includes [FEX-EMU](https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX), a tool for translating ARM64 to x86_64.
